# realtor-api-server
This is the public version of my Real Estate API's server.

There are two other parts to this API, the update server, which downloads listings and photos for new listings; and the frontend.

Here is an example of the API out in the wild, though this repos code is not yet deployed to prod. So it doesn't exactly line up as expected.

The frontend repo will eventually be ready for public release but right now it's a hot mess, I wrote it a while back and it needs some 2020 love.
